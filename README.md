# DefensiveProgramming

When building our software we must build a strong foundation and as such we're expected to build a beautiful wall to protect us from the outside influence!

However..! Most large countries have fallen from the inside-out...

Before we start building the foundation we must first realize the risk of the building process itself to protect ourselves and people we work with
accrodingly! :D
